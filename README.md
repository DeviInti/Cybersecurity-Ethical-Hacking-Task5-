Capstone Project: Mini SIEM & Incident Response
This repository documents the deployment of a functional ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log analysis. The project demonstrates real-world defensive skills by performing an SSH brute-force attack simulation (Hydra) and successfully executing the Containment phase of Incident Response by implementing a firewall block (iptables) after log-based threat identification.
